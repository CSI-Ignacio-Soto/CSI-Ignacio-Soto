      My goals for when I grow are getting to a military Brach called the Coast Guard.
       I want to go the Coast guard beacuse when I was 10 years old in my dads job I ones saw the coast guard
        helicopter landing in a helipath and also it has a lot of choices to work and it has lots of Benefits.
       Some of the Benefits that the Coast Guard has are that you only have to work for 20 years and
        then you can retire, You can go to the shopping military base and don't have to pay taxes, you can travel the world
        in the coast Guard, Have housing And you don't have to buy a house for a certain time, and if you have kids
        they have a school that you don't have to pay. 

        The  subjects that I would like to learn to go to the coast guard are helicopter pilot, Boat Captain and, electrician engineer.
        I would like to learn this three subjects beacuse I like those three subjects and also so that I have more than one chices. I like boat captain
